Python Challenge Module 3 for UofT Bootcamp
.py files with names - "main_pybank" and "main_pypoll" hold the main executable script

Some errors faced during coding include -
  TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'int' and 'tuple'
  The error occurred due to trying to conduct mathematical operations between an integer and a tuple.
    Debugging: checking script to fix variable "previous_amount" which was accidentally made a tuple(accidentally inserted a         "," in line 14 of main_pybank.py script between "[0]" and "[amount]") instead of an integer.  

Corrections were made to print() to fit the requirements of the challenge as accurately as possible. 

Note - "cndt" in main_pypoll.py script stands for candidate. This should help understand the script to the fullest.
